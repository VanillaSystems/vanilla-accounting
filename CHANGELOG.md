# Changelog

What changed in each version of Vanilla Accounting. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the version numbers follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) applies
it to this project. `npm run update` prints the sections between your old version and the new one.

Two markers flag an entry you must read before you update:

- **⚠ figures**: the change alters a computed figure (a VAT Ziffer, a balance, a return) of an
  open period. A filed quarter's figures never change. After the update, `npm run test:books`
  shows the difference; check it, then accept it with `npm run test:books:update`.
- **⚠ action**: you must do something by hand, as the entry says.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Audit export: `npm run build:audit -- <folder>` writes a read-only copy of the books that
  runs from any static file server, without Node.js or the API. Search, filters, every report
  and the receipt PDFs work in it; the audit bar names the snapshot's date, books schema and app
  version. Its `manifest.json` holds the SHA-256 of every file and the seals of the filed
  quarters, and `npm run verify-audit -- <folder>` checks it later. Real books on a public URL
  publish them: `docs/audit-export.md` says how to hand an export over or host it behind access
  protection.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- `books.json` and `belege.workspace.yaml` name their format version (`schema`). The app reads
  older files and migrates them in memory; it refuses a file from a newer version and says to
  update. `npm run update` writes the migrated files, with a backup in `data/backups/`.
- Seals of filed quarters: `npm run seal -- <YYYY-Qn> --close` closes a filed quarter and writes
  `filings/<year>/seal-<Qn>.json`, a hash of every entry, transaction and mapping up to its last
  day. Every load checks the seals. Books whose sealed part changed open read-only.
  `npm run doctor` reports the seals.
- `npm run update`: pulls the newest version, installs changed dependencies, migrates the
  workspace, then runs `doctor` and `test:books`. It stops at the first failure with the fix.
- `npm run init` sets up a company's workspace from 14 questions. `npm run doctor` checks the
  tools, the workspace and the mailboxes. A getting-started guide, a mailbox setup guide and a
  step-by-step quarter workflow.
- A second demo company, a one-person consultancy (`demo-consulting/`), with salaries and a
  correction (0535) paid.
- A casebook of 32 invented Swiss booking cases, checked against the VAT engine, which booking
  uses as examples when a company has little history of its own. `npm run mine-cases`.
- Bank statements (camt.053) of any Swiss bank. A statement lands on the bank account of its
  IBAN, else of its folder; nothing falls back silently.
- `npm run gaps`: the open transactions that no supplier, customer or authority file covers.
- Knowledge by role: the app ships supplier, customer and authority files (ESTV,
  Ausgleichskasse, cantonal tax office, BAZG); a workspace adds its own under `knowledge/`.
- Generic booking rules for payroll, social insurance, the VAT payment, the owner's account,
  direct taxes, refunds of sales and services abroad.

### Changed

- The app is called Vanilla Accounting. The workspace variable is `VANILLA_WORKSPACE`;
  `BELEGE_WORKSPACE` still works and prints a note.
- **⚠ action**: a workspace's `counterparties/` and `policy/` folders moved to
  `knowledge/{suppliers,customers,authorities,rules}/`. Run `npm run migrate-workspace` once and
  commit the workspace.
- One chart of accounts (Swiss KMU) for new workspaces. Booking works without a prior-year
  export.
- A manifest without `schema` reads as schema 1. Before, it was refused.

### Fixed

- An I-code on an investment account (1500 to 1799) is valid.
- An IMAP fetch closes the connection after a refused login.
- `doctor` treats a missing `beleg-import/` as a note: git does not keep the empty folder.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- The first public version. Bookkeeping for a Swiss GmbH with VAT by the effective method on
  cash basis: camt.053 import (with grouped payments), receipt collection by mail, receipt
  matching and booking with Claude, the ESTV daily rate at the payment date for foreign
  currencies, the VAT Ziffern per quarter, the eCH-0217 XML for the ESTV portal, the
  Korrekturabrechnung (0535) of a filed quarter, and the period lock (`config.closedThrough`).
- A React UI with a local API server, the CLI scripts, a demo workspace, the processes in
  `processes/`, the golden master of the VAT figures, and the leak guard (`npm run check-public`).
